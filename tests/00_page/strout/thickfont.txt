On “aster morning in the year 194, I took my six-year-old
son by the hand and beran walking fron my home town toward the
valleys and forests of the Carpathian ountains.. For nearly
eight months we livea in barns, attics and makeshift cabins. “ith
the generous help of an unusually courageous man, we managed to
survive Europe's greatest fit of madness. Those who walked in
the opposite direction on that Easter day were less fortunate.
They were taken in trainloads to places whose once obscure nanes
are now, and forever will be, synonymous with terror, evil and
death. What follows is our story of survival told to the best
of my ability, in plain, simple language.

In March of 1944 the SS troops took over the internal affairs
of Hungary and proceeded to organize the deportation of the Jews.
fo the Nazis this was a routine assignment; within hours all local
officials were informed of operational plans. The high command
issued a directive designed to placate Jewish fears and induce
cooperation. It was announced that the Jews would be shipped to
Polarsi as an emergency labor force and that they, were only beins
drafted for temporary work. There were many who believed this
version. Others, less credulous, resigred themselves and hoped for
the best. Still others began to make plans for escape. By Aprii
13 the Hungarian Jews were being rounded up from all over the
country in what was once a huge brick factory. The rest is well
known. ,

At that time it was no longer possible fer a view to travel freely.
