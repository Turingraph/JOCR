On Easter morning in the year 1%, I took my six-year-old

son by the hand and beran walking fron my home town toward the

valleys and forests of the Carpathian vountains. For nearly
eight months we Lived in barns, attics and makeshift cabins. â€˜ith
the generous help of an unusually courageous man, we managed to
survive Europe's greatest fit of madness. Those who walked in

the opposite direction on that Easter day were less fortunate.
They were taken in trainloads to places whose once obscure nanes
are now, and forever will be, synonymous with terror, evil and
death. What follows is our story of survival told to the best

of my ability, in plain, simple language.

In March of 1944 the SS troops took over the internal affairs
of Hungary and vroceeded to organize the deportation of the Jews,
fo the Nazis this was a routine assignment; within hours all local
officials were informed of operational plans. The high command
issued a directive designed to placate Jewish fears and induce
cooperation. It was announced that the Jews would be shipped to
Polari as an emergency labor force and that they were only beings
drafted for temporary work. There were many who believed this
version. Others, less credulous, resigred themselves and hoped for
the best. Still others began to make plans for escape. By Apri
13 the Hungarian Jews were being rounded up from all over the
country in what was once a huge brick factory. The rest is well
known. ,

I war working in Urevar and usually came home on weekends.

At that time it was no lonser possible fer a Jew to travel freely.
