Page segmentation modes
There are several ways a page of text can be analysed. The tesseract api provides several page segmentation modes if you want to run OCR on only a small region or in different orientations, etc.

Here's a list of the supported page segmentation modes by tesseract -

0    Orientation and script detection (OSD) only.
1    Automatic page segmentation with OSD.
2    Automatic page segmentation, but no OSD, or OCR.
3    Fully automatic page segmentation, but no OSD. (Default)
4    Assume a single column of text of variable sizes.
5    Assume a single uniform block of vertically aligned text.
6    Assume a single uniform block of text.
7    Treat the image as a single text line.
8    Treat the image as a single word.
9    Treat the image as a single word in a circle.
10    Treat the image as a single character.
11    Sparse text. Find as much text as possible in no particular order.
12    Sparse text with OSD.
13    Raw line. Treat the image as a single text line, bypassing hacks that are Tesseract-specific.

To change your page segmentation mode, change the --psm argument in your custom config string to any of the above mentioned mode codes.

'''
osd = pytesseract.image_to_osd(img)
angle = re.search('(?<=Rotate: )\d+', osd).group(0)
script = re.search('(?<=Script: )\d+', osd).group(0)
print("angle: ", angle)
print("script: ", script)
'''

'''
custom_config = r'--oem 3 --psm 6 outputbase digits'
print(pytesseract.image_to_string(img, config=custom_config))
'''
