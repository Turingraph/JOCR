JOCR MVP coding plan
1. Changing coding style (1 day, if we use more time than that, use only 5 coding rules and chaning tyle again in 1 day)
2. Executing and documenting test (1 day, if we use more time that that, delete 1 to 2 sub folders)
3. Refactor img_process (3 days)
4. Make img_to_str (1 day)
5. Make table (3 days, if we use more time than that, ignore it in MVP)
6. Make front-end with one page (5 days)
7. User doc (1 day)
8. tesseract_ocr_installation.md (1 day, if use time more than that, ignore it)
9. Code review (1 day, focus on first 2 SOLID principles and coding smell, if use time more that that, use another 1 day refactor every things except table)
10. Deploy (2 days, if use more than that contact Jojo)
